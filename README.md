learning the basics of github repositories

Hello GitHub,

My excitement about Information Technology has brought me here!
I want to learn as much as I can about the language of computers and how to utilize basic programs to make my life easier as an I.T. professional.
I am starting with python as my first language and I will be sharing my projects soon.
